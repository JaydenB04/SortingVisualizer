# SortingVisualizer

• Developed a sorting visualizer using the Python programming language and turtle library to demonstrate various
sorting algorithms visually.

• Implemented Quick Sort and Selection Sort algorithms to sort a list of random bars and visualized the sorting
process using turtle graphics.

• Designed a graphical user interface using the turtle library to allow users to interact with the sorting visualizer and
choose the sorting algorithm, list size, and sorting speed
